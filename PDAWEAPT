Bare Hands$The pen may ironically be the deadliest weapon on Earth,but the human body itself is a close second. Throughout all of mankind’s history,the training and discipline of the human body as a deadly weapon has been recognized and practiced by all cultures and civilizations. Under the brutal regimen of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, the marines of the USMC and UAC are built to be walking killing machines, even in the absence of artificial tools. Despite the body’s ability to adapt to almost any situation, such athletic diversity also demands the highest maintenance of any weapon - a poorly trained or fed body will get you nowhere - and the mouth attached to that body may get you (or someone else) put in either a cast or a coffin.$Melee_Attacks$Manufacturer: N/A

Fire Axe$Though Mars once had water on it millions of years ago, the iron desert is no longer an Earth-like planet in the slightest. This is why, on Mars, even the tiniest of uncontrolled fires can be a HUGE disaster. Throughout Mars City, one can find all the proper safety tools for combating fires, including extinguishers and axes. Practice proper safety precautions when using such tools.

MIXOM Beavertooth(TM) Chainsaw$The Beavertooth(TM)-brand chainsaw is a rotary blade power tool (primarily designed for lumber work) that can serve as an improvised (albeit extremely messy) weapon. Early on in the development of Mars City, a shipment of chainsaws was mistakenly sent instead of a much-needed set of jackhammers. For a time, these tools served zero practical use until the construction of the Mars City Terrarium in 2097, where they are now used to harvest large trees grown in the artificial biome. Unlike the chainsaws of many previous generations, MIXOM’s design runs on a long-term electric motor rather than gas. No refuelling is necessary. $PB_Chainsaw$Manufacturer: MIXOM Tools

UAC-B950 .45 Pistol$Produced in-house, the UAC worked directly with Belgian firearms manufacturer (FN) Herstal to create a sidearm evocative of the early 21st Century classics such as the “Five-seveN” and FNX series. In the 22nd century, this collaboration resulted in the B950 pistol. Designed as a successor to its modernized variants from the earlier decades, the B950 is a semi-automatic, 15-round handgun that is both lightweight and concealable, despite possessing a double-stack profile. This handgun acts as a supplemental weapon for all standard UAC loadouts, and troops are provided with a Model 5 suppressor attachment which minimizes muzzle flash and directional noise. This optimizes the weapon for stealth engagements and Black Operations in close-quarters environments. $PB_Pistol$Manufacturer: Fabrique Nationale Herstal (Part of UAC)

UAC-B750 .500 ‘Hand Cannon’ Revolver$Like the B950, this powerful revolver was developed in house by the UAC alongside firearms manufacturer Smith and Wesson, the objective being to produce a decorative sidearm for more seasoned officers with at least 5 years of service with Union Aerospace. A classically designed revolver with weights and barrel porting, this recoil compensation works well enough to allow well-trained operators to dual wield, if they procure a second Hand Cannon. Like most revolving magnums, expert users can fan the action to produce a high rate of fire. As much as the UAC prizes active minds, using one's imagination to pretend you're in a western is considered unsafe, and hammer fanning will NOT be taught in training exercises or drills.$PB_Revolver$Manufacturer: Smith & Wesson (Part of UAC)

UAC-H54 ‘Martian Raptor’ Automag $Initially developed by Israeli weapons manufacturer IMI, the Desert Eagle was designed to be an automatic, magazine-loading alternative to high-caliber revolvers. When the company was acquired by the UAC in 2068, a modern rendition was commissioned, and christened as the Martian Raptor. Chambered in .50 Action Express, the weapon is capable of serving up one-shot death to most standard foes. In addition to offering a higher fire rate than its cylindrical counterpart,the design gives it far more reliable accuracy. In fact, the only downside to this weapon is its potential to break your wrist.$PB_Deagle$Manufacturer: Israeli Military Industries (Part of UAC)

UAC-17 Compact Submachine Gun$Zulu Sec tested nearly two-dozen SMGs from different manufacturers, and almost settled on the latest from H&K. However, corporate could not hash out a financial deal, so Zulu, undeterred, tasked the BFRD with making an in-house solution to their needs - high RPM, low recoil, lightweight, and a minimum of 100 rounds. Unfortunately, such a large magazine broke the weight specifications, so a compromise was made to resize the magazine storage in half. The result was a 50-round platform that was so lightweight it could be fired accurately even with one in each hand. The UAC-17 was officially adopted in 2132 and has proven highly effective in indoor sweep-ops and the more confined areas of [REDACTED].

UAC-GS10 Pump Shotgun$After completely buying out Remington Arms, the UAC commissioned its staff to make a shotgun for trusted marines guarding their posts, resulting in the GS10. Designed to fire 12-gauge shells of varying loads, this weapon will be a mainstay tool on Mars on most situations - as the close-quarters of the colony make this weapon ideal for ripping large portions out of threats. It features a ‘slam-fire’ mechanism, so the user can perpetually hold the trigger - chambering a round will fire the weapon instead, so long as the user is holding the switch down. $PB_Shotgun$Manufacturer: Remington Arms (Part of UAC)
