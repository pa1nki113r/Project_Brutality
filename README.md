# Project Brutality

This is the primary repository for collaborative efforts between Doom developers on Project Brutality.
This is the bleeding-edge version that is constantly being developed on, and not meant in any way shape or form to be representative of the final version of the mod.

## Installing Project Brutality

### How To Download

You will need the latest version of [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads "GZDoom")[^zandronum?] ([Delta Touch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opentouchgaming.deltatouch&hl=en_US&gl=US "Delta Touch") for Android, or [GenZD](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genzd/id6503916449 "GenZD") for iOS) and either a copy of the one of the official IWADs[^Steam][^GOG] or [Freedoom Phase 1+2](https://freedoom.github.io/download.html "Freedoom"). To download the latest build, scroll up to the top and click the green button labeled __Code__ then click [Download Zip](https://github.com/pa1nki113r/Project_Brutality/archive/refs/heads/master.zip "You can also click here to download."). If you are on mobile and don't see a button, you'll need to turn on desktop view.

### Running addons

When loading more than just PB, It is highly recommended you use a Front-end Launcher, such as [ZDL](https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl/releases "A rather simple, yet extremely flexible launcher"), [DoomRunner](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner/releases "If you want something that is just as flexible or newer than ZDL") or [SSGL](https://github.com/FreaKzero/ssgl-doom-launcher/releases/tag/v2.0.0-devpreview.24 "First timer, casual player, a Doomsday Engine launcher fan, or just want something with more personality?")

## Feedback and Bug Reporting

While we would love to hear your opinions and ideas, Issues are reserved for bug reports only. Please make sure that the bug is with the mod itself and not due to any add-ons. The team is not responsible for any addons. Even if the add-on is made by a member of the dev team, it is not our resposibility to fix it, but instead is up to the add-on's creator on whether or not they fix it. Also make sure the issue has not already been posted.

Any suggestions, opinions, or questions should be posted on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2hJxXPc "Come join us :)"). Don't forget to check the rules and faq channels, as well as each channel's pins and description.

##### NOTE: MOTION BLUR ON SPRITES IS AN ARTISTIC CHOICE, NOT LAZINESS. NO, WE WILL NOT CHANGE IT.
